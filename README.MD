## NOTES FROM DEVELOPER :

- all rendering is done in render.cpp
- the game is all made in main.cpp
- objects & classes are in the entities folder

 I've been testing and compiling this program completely on macOS so I'm not exactly sure if the compiling requirements are different for windows or linux, but if you run the makefile it should compile just fine on macOS.

## HOW TO COMPILE/BUILD CODE :

1. cd to directory:
     cd 'I3DG A1'
2. run "make" or "bash build.sh" inside folder (they do the same thing):
     make
     (or) bash build.sh
3. ./game to run game
     ./game
4. "make clean" to clean
     make clean
