s3728738 – Aren Carter Balgos


- all rendering is done in render.cpp
- the game is all made in main.cpp
- objects & classes are in the entities folder

note from developer: I've been testing and compiling this program completely on macOS so I'm not exactly sure if the compiling requirements are different for windows or linux, but if you run the makefile it should compile just fine on macOS.

## instructions to compile :
1. cd to directory:
     cd 'I3DG A1
2. run "make" inside folder:
     make
3. ./game to run game
     ./game
4. "make clean" to clean
     make clean
